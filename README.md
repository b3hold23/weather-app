## Features
A great feature on this site is that you can get the history of the cities you have looked up and you can delete the history as well. Look at the image below to see this feature. ![delete feature of dashboard](./Assets/dashboard.JPG)
<br>
Other features is has is that it will tell you the temp of the city you look up. I am using an API to achieve this. The code is getting the name of the city from the user and it will fetch the api request and get the info of that city. Then the code will render the html page to display this information.
